Work flow, task, priorities and efforts.

- decided on a version control system, historically cvs, should I convert to git
	answer: yes - git w/ gitolite for a central repository.

- hosting - what platform should the system run on
	fedora linux

- create a git central repository for all product related files.
	git@cworld.local:ScrummyBDDHelper

- start documenting features, tools and methodologies.
	See files in doc directory.

- Priority, develop tests to verify the features as soon as possible.

- Priority, get a better tool than this file to track tasks.
	Evaluate bugzilla - postponed, reading the installation instructions reminded me that my new fedora 19 system was not being backed up.

- Priority: setup and test a backup system on the development environment. 
	Considered backup-manager - rejected, limited feature set. 
	Pursuing Bacula.

	Installing bacula via yum install *bacula* - could be interesting…

2013-08-21 09:03
	yep interesting … bacula can use mysql or postgres. I chose to go with mysql, so had to get the mysql server up and running, including auto startup. Install the bacula database, set up the config. Then found out the 'yum' version of bacula was compiled with only postgres support. 

	Install postgres server, auto restart, remote connections. Done. Back to initialize and config bacula
2013-08-21 14:36
	Running first full backup - need to test - only 11G of disk used on system, shouldn't take too long.
	BREAK TIME :)
2013-08-21 16:58
	1 out of 3 not bad :) - ok have to fix giolite and postgres backups.

2013-08-22 13:23 Back to work (good day at the soup kitchen - stew for 600 :)
	testing gitolite backup now - had sudo instead of su, pops
	also bacula-dir was not running as root, need to for the su's 
2013-08-22 15:14
	ok bacula tested. restore's look great. next is … double check bugzilla commitment. I'm gonna dig a bit and I have to focus on other priorities for the next 5 days.  I'll be back!

2013-08-24 10:11 hmm need to list installed packages (at least the specific major's yum did the rest, but probably a good idea to add current configuration to the product's implementation documentation.
nginx
php-fpm - what is this? - recommended by nginx probably nginx answer to mod_php
python2.7
phthon3.3
django
gitolite
mysql-server (mariadb-server)
postgresql-server
bacula

2013-08-24 10:29 - 20130824.installed.packages.txt created and added to git.
nginx config looks cool. Have enough understating to start it up.

2013-08-24 11:15 nginx default page works - installing bugzilla using nginx under 
http:://myhost.local/bugzilla

yum install bugzilla # installing ton's of perl modules.
2013-08-24 11:19 on to configuration.

2013-08-24 12:11 problems with bugzilla checksetup.pl - problem boiling down to:

[root@cworld bugzilla]# /usr/bin/perl -MEmail::Reply -e 'print "hi\n";
> ^C
[root@cworld bugzilla]# /usr/bin/perl -MEmail::Reply -e 'print "hi\n";'

going for a clan install.

Problem 2 : CPAN: install Module ??? Compat

2013-08-24 12:32 yum install "perl(Module::Pluggable)" was required.

best answer seems to be the wrong / broken version of 
cpan[16]> i Email::Abstract
Module id = Email::Abstract
    CPAN_USERID  RJBS (Ricardo SIGNES <rjbs@cpan.org>)
    CPAN_VERSION 3.005
    CPAN_FILE    R/RJ/RJBS/Email-Abstract-3.005.tar.gz
    UPLOAD_DATE  2013-07-30
    MANPAGE      Email::Abstract - unified interface to mail representations
    INST_FILE    /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl/Email/Abstract.pm
    INST_VERSION 3.002


cpan[17]> install Email::Abstract

then 

install Email::Reply

2013-08-24 12:54 worked.

now bugzilla checksetup.pl is gripping about mysql - time to setup localconfig as directed:

2013-08-24 13:49 bug repot submitted to fedora project.

now one to CPAN about Email::Reply failing because of Email::Abstract version.

2013-08-25 08:42 installing fcgiwrap from git clone git://github.com/gnosek/fcgiwrap
   -- wait
2013-08-25 08:50 hmm fund yum install spawn-fcgi - looks like the same thing. Trying that first.

creating /usr/local/bin/cgiwrap-fcgi.pl from http://wiki.nginx.org/SimpleCGI

 sudo yum install perl-FCGI-ProcManager (needed by cgiwrap-fcgi.pl)


2013-08-25 13:05 ugg big fun w/ security
SELinux is preventing /usr/sbin/nginx from write access on the sock_file cgiwrap-dispatch.sock.

*****  Plugin catchall (100. confidence) suggests  ***************************

If you believe that nginx should be allowed write access on the cgiwrap-dispatch.sock sock_file by default.
Then you should report this as a bug.
You can generate a local policy module to allow this access.
Do
allow this access for now by executing:
# grep nginx /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M mypol
# semodule -i mypol.pp

2013-08-25 15:23 cgiwrap-fcgi NOT working :( - going to try fastcgi-wrapper.

Just can't seem to get cgiwrap-fcgi to run bugzilla. fastcgi-wrapper is actually the same script as cgiwrap. Now trying with fcgiwrap https://github.com/gnosek/fcgiwrap

2013-08-26 08:12 was working on fcgiwrap.service and decided time to learn all about systemd (linux initialization) 
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/

2013-08-26 08:40 now he is getting it. It is truly time to write my own fastcgi wrapper service using python and working efficiently with systemd. 

Feature given a fastcgi script request, run the cgi script.

2013-08-26 09:25 partial success - bugzilla index page actually visible - LOTS of issues, but progress.
2013-08-26 10:37 bugzilla is up and running under http:://host/bugzilla/index.cgi

Lots to FIXME - change fastcgi to use systemd socket interface.

Look for configuration / startup / performance improvements.

2013-08-26 12:37 Ugg that took hours. home page http://cworld.local/bugzilla was not working. issue with configuring nginx. works now.

2013-08-26 15:06 breaking my own rule already. I should be working on the testing of the current system, but I want to wait to understand jenkins through trial and error (and reading) before I start writing tests. At least I've already started writing BDD features :)


2013-08-26 17:00 last night's backup failed, causing issues with integrating jenkins. time to fix it. Would be nice to integrate bacula with bugzilla.

2013-08-27 09:51 I've been studying systemd some more and thinking about the production level system setup and installation. This should be part of the tests. Build a system from scratch, automatically. Start it up, verify all operations against that new system. The process should work for both virtual machines and real bare bones hardware.

2013-08-27 10:26 systemd lead me to libvirt and puppet. Doing some research on Virtual Machine. I believe testing should be performed on a virtual machine. It strengthens the production environment setup process.

2013-08-27 11:01 yep time to learn puppet. Reasoning, I want to be able to create a dev/test/prod environment with a single command.  This process will be implemented using continuous integration and BDD.

Spending time to understand puppet will increase my understanding of effective system configuration.

2013-08-27 11:33 Need to install a VM system to learn puppet to configure a VM. So installing Xen.

yum install xen - YAY! :)

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Archive:Tools/Xen?rd=FedoraXenQuickstart - perfect

Downloaded centOS-6.4-x86_64-minimal.iso

2013-08-27 13:17 ok here's the plan. Break first …
Create a Logical partition to hold my new CentOS install. use Xen to run the centOS-install ISO and tell it to install to my new partition - will have to be visible to install process as a viable partition. Once that works (take a while i bet) then boot my new centOS system and start installing packages and performing configuration via puppet.

Then create a VM image to be used by the test system and test will make the production installation process.

Looks like I have test to write:

Feature: test are executed on a virtual machine

  Scenario: test need to be run
     Given: the test virtual machine is not available.
      When: tests are run
      Then: the test virtual environment is available.
       And: the test proceed.


2013-08-27 14:16 Ugg reboot did not use the correct boot image for xen - fixing …

2013-08-27 14:28 time to learn all about fedora boot and grub2

2013-08-28 06:12 been at it for some time this morn. Got grub figured out. Xen kernel running, logical volume testvm created, time to get a vm running (I hope).

2013-08-28 06:23 ugg just found 'fedora 19 virtualization doc' this might change things …
nope - just pushed virsh over xl. back to setting up my vm

2013-08-28 14:17 ARG been fighting all day and now I learn that red hat is going to KVM. ok time to get KVM working. At least I've been spending most of my time getting a bare bonds CentOS 6.4 kernel ready. Made it through first step - installed on a partition, but may have to do that all over again. UGG these inflexible installation processes!@

The CentOS install to the USB drive should have provided full EFI config option. uggg.


http://centos.icyboards.com/6.4/isos/x86_64/CentOS-6.4-x86_64-netinstall.iso
http://mirrordenver.fdcservers.net/centos/6.4/os/x86_64/

2013-08-29 06:20 all sorts of issues this morning - bacula did not back up and did not report

bugzilla not working because fast cgi socket was not there - heck the /var/run/nginx directory disappeared. Sure like to know how that got removed.

YUCK MORE BUGS

Now can't get windows clipboard :(

FINALLY. time to restart x and the laptop - looks like a busy day.

2013-08-29 06:45 bugzilla works again - restarted fcgiwrap service after creating /var/run/nginx dir.

NOPE pip-3 (and 2.7) need to install requests - I'm using it in my testing.
lets just use urllib for now pretty simple tests so far.

installed gitpython

yum install GitPython

2013-08-31 08:57 lots of folks seem to be using Trac. and I'm seeing some integration with Jenkins. Adding it as a component.

2013-08-31 14:10 ok, in installing Trac, I saw all the system configuration tasks that have to be performed. I've heard that puppet is very good at this (btw it's ruby) and it is probably the best solution at being able to reproduce the services on random hosts.

First step - hmmm ….
